# Pomodoro
This is a Python script for a Pomodoro Timer application using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.


CODE WORKING
The script creates a window using Tkinter with a tomato image, a timer display, start and reset buttons, and a checkmark display for completed work intervals.

Constants for colors, fonts, and time durations are defined at the beginning of the script.

The timer mechanism uses a "reps" variable to keep track of the number of work intervals completed. The script alternates between work intervals, short breaks, and a long break after every 4 work intervals.

When the user clicks the "Start" button, the timer begins counting down. The timer is displayed on the canvas, and the current mode (Work, Break, Long Break) is shown at the top. When the timer reaches 00:00, the script automatically starts the next interval.

The "Reset" button stops the timer, resets the display, and clears any completed work session checkmarks.

The checkmark display keeps track of completed work sessions, showing a checkmark for each work interval.Users can start, reset, and track their work intervals easily. The tomato image adds a fun and recognizable touch to the timer.

To use this code, you need to have the tomato.png image file in the same directory as the script.
