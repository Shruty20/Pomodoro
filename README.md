# Pomodoro
This is a Python script for a Pomodoro Timer application using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
